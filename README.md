# Wabbajack Auto-Downloader
You don't need to keep the window open, it can work in the background.

# Usage
Replace the button.png and scroll.png with the ones from your Wabbajack window, if it works out of the box, you don't need to change anything

# Setup
```
git clone https://github.com/ninthy/wabbajack-dl.git
cd wabbajack-dl
uv sync
uv run main.py
